0.2.5432, 07 October 2008
-----------------------------
  - ADDED: STRIP flag to progs
  - FIXED: Link errors did not cause make to fail on OpenBSD.
       The reason was that the exit code of the pipeline command used to suppress OpenBSD-specific warnings:
       ( $(LINKER) $(OBJS) $(LIBS) $(LFLAGS) -o $(OUT_DIR)/$(.TARGET) 3>&1 1>&2 2>&3 | sed "/In function/N;/warning.*misused, please use/d" ) 3>&1 1>&2 2>&3
       was the exit code of the last command on the pipeline that is 'sed' which almost always succeeded.
       The fix was in removing this warning suppression filter.
   - FIXED: conditionals syntax for GNU make

0.1.5241, 26 August 2008
