1. Use KeyTalk Windows client Development VM as a base system for the build server (make sure new VM UUID is created)

2. Install CruiseControl.net

3. Make sure paths in ContinuousIntegration\cc.net\ccnet.config and ContinuousIntegration\cc.net\ccservice.exe.config are correct, create directories for build logs and build state is necessary

4. Copy/merge ContinuousIntegration\cc.net\ccservice.exe.config to the one installed by CruiseControl.NET (typically in C:\Program Files\CruiseControl.NET\server), backing up the original one first.

5. Copy build output stylesheet(s) from ContinuousIntegration\cc.net\xsl\ directory to C:\Program Files\CruiseControl.NET\server\xsl\

6. Upload build server ssh private key id_rsa to %USERPROFILE%/.ssh/ on the build server
    - This key allows read-only access to KeyTalk git repository
    - make sure repository URL with key authentication is used: ssh://git@stash.keytalk.com:7999/keytalk/core.git

7. Configure CruiseControl.net service to start automatically under current user account instead of default LocalSystem.
   -  LocalSystem account would not allow using ssh key and installing client ini files to the user profile
	- see %tmp%\ccnet.log for troubleshooting

8 Create minimal KeyTalk client installation:
  - Change path in ContinuousIntegration\cc.net\resept.ini if needed
  - Import CertKeys\CommunicationAndSigning\pcacert.der to the "Trusted Root" Windows certificate store
  - Import CertKeys\CommunicationAndSigning\signingcacert.der to the "Intermediate" Windows certificate store.

9. [optionally] Download, install and configure CcTray tool (from http://sourceforge.net/projects/ccnet/files/CruiseControl.NET%20Releases/CruiseControl.NET%201.8.5/ or later version)
   - make sure to allow firewall to allow monitoring of CC.NET server from the outside

10. Make a test build run, e.g. by kicking it from CcTray.
  - check log directory (e.g. D:\builds\logs\) and %tmp%\ccnet.log for troubleshooting
  - update md5 of %windir%\winhlp32.exe on the server (CUST_PASSWD_INTERNAL_FILE service) if necessary

11. Set system time to UTC

12. Share KeyTalk source folder (read-only) as "builds" so developers can access it from their machines

13. Enable Remote Desktop connections to this machine

14. Convert VMX VM to OVF and import it to Vmware ESX server
