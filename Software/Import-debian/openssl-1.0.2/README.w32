Building hardened OpenSSL-1.0.2l static libraries for KeyTalk client on Windows
-----------------------------------

This folder contains Windows build (static library and includes) of OpenSSL-1.0.2l hardened to enable extra security as demanded by KeyTalk project

Prerequisites:
------------------
- MS Windows 7 32-bit
- MS Visual Studio 2013
- Perl (e.g. ActivePerl)
- NASM installed
- Downloaded and extracted OpenSSL source archive


Build libraries
------------------

1. Open command prompt and call vcvarsall.bat from VS directory to expand VC environment variables e.g.
"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat"

  Create makefile

> pushd <openssl-extract-dir>
> perl Configure VC-WIN32
> ms\do_nasm

2. Edit the generated ms\nt.mak:
- Replace /MT compiler flag (static CRT) with /MD (shared CRT)
- Remove /debug from LFLAGS
- Add /SAFESEH to LFLAGS
- Set path to nasm.exe in "ASM" setting, e.g.
	ASM="C:\Program Files\nasm\nasm.exe" -f win32

3. Build libraries with

> nmake -f ms\nt.mak

Windows include files are found in inc32/ subdirectory
Static libraries are created under out32/
lib.pdb debug file is found under tmp32/ directory
Copy all these to KeyTalk Import openssl directory

4. Change OPENSSL_LIB_VERSION_DIR for KeyTalk Windows Client Common Property page:
   - VC -> View -> Property Manger -> <Select any project> -> KeyTalk Windows Client Common -> Double Click -> User Macros
   - alternatively you can edit WinClientCommon.props by hand and reload VC solution afterwards
Rebuild and retest KeyTalk Windows client


To clean the build when something fails or do a new build:
> nmake -f ms\nt.mak clean
